LeukoDif is a revolutionary AI tool that employs the power of Denoising Diffusion Medical Models (DDMM) to perform image synthesis and segmentation on a Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) dataset. This model has reparametrized VAE architecture, using encoders/decoders as a entry point for latent space in diffusion model. The mathematical formulas & code aspects were adapted from ideas of UC Berkeley paper "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model."
