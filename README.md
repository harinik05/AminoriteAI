LeukoDif is a revolutionary AI tool that employs the power of Denoising Diffusion Medical Models (DDMM) to perform image synthesis and segmentation on a Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) dataset. This model has reparametrized VAE architecture, using encoders and decoders as a entry point for latent space in diffusion model. The mathematical formulas & code aspects were adapted from ideas of UC Berkeley paper "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model." 

## Features
1. **Unsupervised machine learning**: Refers to the ability of the ML model to learn from the neural network without having to label the image set. In this particular scenario, we're going to use unsupervised learning for the generation of ALL images, regardless of its type. 
2. **Anomaly Detection**: Detect anomalies or unusual patterns in the propagation of information or behaviors. Sudden deviations from expected diffusion patterns may indicate events and simulate pathological conditions such as outbreaks, cascades, or disruptions in the network.
3. **Robustness to Noise**: DHandle noisy data or incomplete information within the network. They are robust to noise because they focus on the overall patterns of information propagation rather than individual data points.
4. **Generation of Ground Truth Data**: In cases where obtaining ground truth labels for medical images is challenging or subjective, image synthesis can be used to generate synthetic ground truth data (maybe not for industrial reasons).
